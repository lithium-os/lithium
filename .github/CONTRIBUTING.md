## Using AI

The use of AI is a touchy subject. I'm fine with it in small doses. Using it to fix broken code, automate documentation comments, summarize logs, or provide scaffolding to build off of is acceptable. Using it blindly to implement features, write entire subsystems, or attempt to drastically alter the existing codebase is heavily discouraged. Please use AI responsibly, and do not rely on it for everything.

This project is meant to be human-driven. Contributors are expected to understand the code they submit, be able to explain their changes, and take responsibility for maintaining them. AI can be a helpful assistant, but it should never be the author.

### Acceptable Use

* Fixing small, well-scoped bugs
* Generating documentation drafts or comment blocks (that you then review and correct)
* Producing simple boilerplate or scaffolding
* Helping explain unfamiliar code paths
* Suggesting refactors that you personally verify and implement

### Discouraged Use

* Submitting large AI-generated features with minimal understanding
* Bulk refactors generated by prompts
* Style/formatting PRs produced entirely by automation
* “Shotgun” changes across many files without clear justification

### Agents & Automated Contributions

PRs created primarily by autonomous agents (e.g., “AI dev bots”, automated feature generators, or prompt-driven bulk code submissions) are generally not accepted.

If a pull request appears to be:

* Entirely machine-generated
* Lacking clear author understanding
* Overly broad with no focused scope
* Difficult to justify or maintain

…it will likely be closed without review.

Automated dependency updates are fine when they are small, isolated, and clearly safe. Automated feature PRs are not.

### Accountability

If you used AI to assist in your contribution:

* You are still the author.
* You are responsible for correctness, style, and long-term maintenance.
* You should be able to explain what the code does and why it belongs here.

If you cannot confidently explain the code you’re submitting, please don’t submit it.

### Philosophy

AI is a tool, not a contributor. The goal of this project is to build something understandable, maintainable, and human-owned. Thoughtful, well-reasoned patches will always be valued more than fast, automated ones.
